; unit cell is just size 1 in x direction and no-size in y and z.

; can change that by changing this line, or even easier, by running:
;       mpb d1=0.3 bandgap1d.ctl

; can be varied from the command line like this.)

; Let's set up the k points we want to compute.  Actually, to get the
; band gap we really only need k = pi/a, but we'll compute a range
; of k's in the irreducible Brillouin zone just so that we can make
; nice plots if we want.  Note that k is in units of 2pi/a, so, k=pi/a
; is just given as k=0.5.
